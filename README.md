Python particle tracking code

This is particle tracking code slightly edited from a version downloaded from here: http://people.umass.edu/kilfoil/downloads.html

That code was written in Python by Kevin Smith and Maria Kilfoil and was based on IDL code by John Crocker. 

Some slight modifications of the Kilfoil code were made to work with latest version of python/numpy and to work with multipage tiffs. 

Look for Jupyter notebook files for how to use this code (see [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rmcgorty/ParticleTracking-Python/blob/a8a677908e6d62b921da624cb81612a4cb185a1f/jupyter_notebooks/Particle%20Tracking%20--%20DEMONSTRATION,%20TUTORIAL.ipynb)) and check the [Wiki here](https://github.com/rmcgorty/ParticleTracking-Python/wiki/Short-Guide-to-Particle-Tracking) for instructions.
