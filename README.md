Python particle tracking code

This is particle tracking code downloaded from here: http://people.umass.edu/kilfoil/downloads.html

Some slight modifications of that code were made to work with latest version of python/numpy and to work with multipage tiffs. 

Look for Jupyter notebook files for how to use this code and check the Wiki here for instructions.
