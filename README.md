Python particle tracking code

This is particle tracking code downloaded from here: http://people.umass.edu/kilfoil/downloads.html

That code was written in Python by Kevin Smith and Maria Kilfoil. The code was based on IDL code by John Crocker. 

Some slight modifications of that code were made to work with latest version of python/numpy and to work with multipage tiffs. 

Look for Jupyter notebook files for how to use this code and check the Wiki here for instructions.
